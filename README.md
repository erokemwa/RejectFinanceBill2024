## Installation

Bash
```
pip install --upgrade tweepy
```
Use code with caution.

## Usage

Replace the placeholder values for ```api_key```, ```api_key_secret```, ```access_token```, and ```access_token_secret``` with your actual Twitter API credentials obtained from https://developer.x.com/en.
Modify the query variable to specify the hashtag or keyword you want to analyze.
Run the script:

```
## Functionality

Authentication: Uses ```tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler``` to securely authenticate with the Twitter API.

Error Handling: Incorporates ```try-except``` blocks to gracefully handle potential Tweepy exceptions like rate limits or search errors.

Tweet Search: Leverages ```tweepy.Client.search_recent_tweets``` to fetch recent tweets containing the specified query.

Tweet Filtering: Returns an empty list if no tweets are found to avoid potential errors in subsequent processing.

Content Extraction: Uses regular expressions to identify relevant hashtags, keywords, and entities within tweets, potentially including the provided ```name_regex``` patterns. Customize this regex for your specific needs.

Frequency Analysis: Counts the occurrences of each extracted term using ```collections.Counter```.
Output: Prints the top 10 most frequently mentioned terms.
